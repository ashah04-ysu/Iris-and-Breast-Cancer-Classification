# Iris and Breast Cancer Classification
## Description
This code uses various machine learning algorithms to classify the iris and breast cancer datasets. The algorithms used are Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier. The code performs the following steps for both datasets:

1. Load the datasets
2. Train and fit the Decision Tree model
3. Generate a text representation of the tree model
4. Predict the target values using the fitted model
5. Evaluate the accuracy of the model
6. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
7. Fit and predict the Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier models
8. Evaluate the accuracy of the Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier models
9. Calculate the recall score for the Decision Tree model using cross-validation
## Dependencies
• Numpy
• Pandas
• Scikit-learn
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run the code
## Output
The code will output the following:

1. Text representation of the Decision Tree model for both datasets
2. Accuracy score and classification report for Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier models for both datasets
3. Recall scores for the Decision Tree model for the iris dataset using cross-validation.
